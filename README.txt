This is a repository containing the relevant simulation code and data 
for our manuscript entitled: 
"Collective self-optimization of communicating active particles", by A. Zampetaki, B. Liebchen, A. V. Ivlev and H. Löwen.

This code is  is made available under the GPL license.
Over and above the legal restrictions imposed by this license, if you
use any of the contents for academic research then you are obliged

"Collective self-optimization of communicating active particles", 
(publication details to be provided soon).

## Codes
Two codes are provided "ham1.c" and "non_ham1.c", which were used to extract
the simulation data for the Hamiltonian approximation and the full non-Hamiltonian system, 
studied and discussed in detail in the aforementioned paper.
The codes were written for running in Windows 10, but can be easily adapted to run
in Linux by changing appropriately the random number generator functions.

## Data
The enclosed raw data refer to the Figures 3 and 5 of the manuscript and include 
the final configurations used for the phase diagram of Fig.3 and the 14 particle
trajectories used to construct Fig. 5.
